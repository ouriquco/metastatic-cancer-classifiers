# Metastatic Cancer Binary Classifiers
## This project uses 5 different machine learning model configurations to predict if patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening. 

The purpose of this project is to compete in the WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #1 hosted on Kaggle. The objective is to use a dataset containing patient information (e.g., age, weight, ethnicity) to determine if the patient has received metastic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of their screening. The dataset, provided by WiDS, was extensively explored and preprocessed before training 5 different supervised machine learning models. These models, implemented for binary classification, include:
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Extra Trees
* Stacking Generalization

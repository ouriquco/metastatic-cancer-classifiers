# Metastatic Cancer Binary Classifiers
## This project uses 5 different machine learning model configurations to predict if patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening. 

The purpose of this project is to compete in the WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #1 hosted on Kaggle. The project's objectives is to use a dataset that has patient information (e.g. age, weight, ethnicity) to determine if the patient has received metastic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of their screening. The dataset is provided by WiDS and was heavily explored and preprocessed which is then to train 5 different supervised machine learning models. The machine learning models that are implemented in this project are used for binary classification. These models include:
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Extra Trees
* Stacking Generalization
